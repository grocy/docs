# Looking for the docs

Continue to the [Grocy documentation](tutorial.md) or look below for some stuff about the docs and how to help improve them.

# About docs

This repository is for creating documentation for the grocy project. You can find grocy at https://github.com/grocy/grocy 

The four types of documentation that will be needed are:
1. tutorials - learning-oriented, gets first-time users up and running
2. how-tos - problem-oriented, answers specific scenarios
3. explanations - understanding-oriented, gets contributors up and running
4. reference - information-oriented, serves as a repository of knowledge for contributors

This project will first focus on tutorials. This means that:
- the target audience of these writings are first- and second-time users of Grocy.
- the structure should reflect their exploration of functionality
- technical debt should be minimal
- the language should be clear, with short sentences and an informal tone

The main tutorial page is [tutorial.md](tutorial.md)
